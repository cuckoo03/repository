Unfortunately I'm just a bit paranoid that one morning I'll wake to find that an empty directory has been 'auto' sync'd over all my other copies, as I use the syncing as a way of keeping backups too and like to confirm what unison will do.  I might go this way eventually though as I can't find a dry-run option in unison (though rsync has one).  Thanks for your suggestions." CreationDate="2010-08-26T19:22:20.157" UserId="953" />
